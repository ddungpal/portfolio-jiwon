            I’m a person who is naturally excited by the vague stroke. I
            basically imagine abstract things as a kind of warm up to explore
            unknown possibilities. Specifically, I am curious about the worth of
            indefinableness. With staying away from a verbal definition, I
            prefer to pursue making enough space with circumstance with enough
            distance. I believe that surplus space can lead us to meet our inner
            self. Facing the inner self simutaneously give rise to sense for
            recognizing alien environment where we’ve never been to. I do this
            shapeless approach as an express process in my life continuously.
            Erasing borders and describing poetic fancies with a drawing and
            painting is my fundamental and final itinerary.

          <p className="mb-3 text-xl font-bold">Collaboration</p>
          <p className="line-clamp text-justify">
            The other way of facing the inner self is being together in a
            tranquil, coldish mood. I believe collisions with strangers based on
            respect give birth to rather more public value. Through
            collaboration and criticism with people who work in other
            genres-fashion, traditional music, ai expert etc., we can find out
            that a generalized knowledge sufficiently can be dissolved. Instead,
            we can also redefine it on a relative aspect in each point of view.
            I expect that discerning about things we meet based on collisions
            and criticism will give us a warm and firm intuition for public
            worth. This is what I dreamed of: the way that a private
            conversation with inner thought is being absorbed creatively in the
            world.

            As for me, most of my inspiration is from time I gazed at
            somethings-a scene which I encountered, a circumstance I
            participated in, a relationship with others. Just observing these
            with an earnest curiosity with enough time to relate with it in.
            Intimating conversation starts on time in an appropriate timing when
            I feel associated with any other stranger even if just in an
            imagining. I’m gazing honestly, waiting freely with an expect
            through leaving a surplus space for greeting.

            Facing emptiness-white paper when I do painting drives me implicit
            emotions. These occurred quite momentarily in a strong intuition
            which stems from gazing experience. It also applied in a 3d space I
            imagined and I express it as an Interdisciplinary art by crossing a
            genre. In a process, a whole impromptu imagery becomes substituted
            to a design for human experience. By planning experience in
            exhibition space, a concept of idea is being divided in the aspect
            of space-time detailed. Specifically, I focused on making ‘Intended
            Contingency’ which can lead people to feel sympathy naturally. I
            look forward to this sympathy will be a motive that can penetrate
            peoples’ initial nature in the end.
